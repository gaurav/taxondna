/**
 * This is the final keystone in the FormatHandler system - it was cheap, easy and flexible, but now
 * it gets to be cheaply extensible too. In a nutshell, this is just an ordinary 'listener' for
 * FormatHandlers: you can 'listen' to a variety of events, using a simple constant system to
 * differentiate potentially subtle and complicated events.
 *
 * <p>The really huge question: should listeners get to push content directly into the output file?
 * How should this work? I'll just ignore it until a more appropriate time :).
