/**
 * SortedSequenceList is a sequence list sorted along a varying criterion; in the current version,
 * this criterion is always the same: it's sorted based on its distance to a specified 'query'
 * sequence.
 *
 * <p>This is going to work like this: 1. You create a SortedSequenceList, giving it a SequenceList.
 * - We store a pointer to the SSL 2. You run a 'query' against your SortedSequenceList - We reinit
 * from the SSL; we get rid of sequences without adequate overlap. - We resort our *current* list
 * using a Comparator, created especially for the occasion. - Free the comparator; unlock our
 * sortedSSL for continued access.
