/**
 * SpeciesDetails is a map which allows you get get the SpeciesDetail on any species. Note that you
 * really shouldn't be allowed to access all this directly. (hence the private constructors; I
 * assume there's a better way of doing this I don't know about) So you call
 * SequenceList.getSpeciesDetails(), from which you can countSpecies(),
 * countSpeciesWithMultipleSequences(), and so on, as well as getSpeciesIterator, which iterates
 * over the SpeciesDetail objects.
 *
 * <p>I would _love_ to find an easier way of doing this, so if you have one, PLEASE let me know!
 * Thanks!
