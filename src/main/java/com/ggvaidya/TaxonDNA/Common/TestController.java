/**
 * A TestController carries out Tests by calling the 'test()' method of Testable objects. The test
 * signals results back to TestController via four methods: testInformation(title, description),
 * testBegin(title), testSuccess(title), testFailure(title, description).
 *
 * <p>The Testable objects are responsible for their own issues - the TestController will only
 * report test status back to the user.
