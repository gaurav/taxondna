/**
 * Interface for DelayCallbacks. Used to keep track of a long process. A function taking a long time
 * can call the DelayCallback object to let it know how things are going.
 *
 * <p>There is now an additional bonus: the DelayCallback object can use the delay(done, total)
 * function to (possibly) abort the process. If the user indicates he wants the process aborted,
 * delay(done, total) will return false.
