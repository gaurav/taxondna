/**
 * A class representing a UUID [1]. Okay, this is a hack. Read my lips: H-A-C-K.
 * I'm only doing this because it'll HELP (not STOP) programs from screwing up.
 * UUID engines are way too complex for me to try and handcode one right now
 * just to get AlignmentHelper working. Plus, hopefully, the WORSE thing that
 * can happen is a collision (two UUIDs are identical), which should be handled
 * by another part of the program - and ideally, that BARFS. So it's all good :).
