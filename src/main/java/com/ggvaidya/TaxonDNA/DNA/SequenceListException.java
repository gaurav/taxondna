/** 	
 * 	A SequenceListException is thrown if there is something
 * 	funny about a SequenceListException. Mostly, this is about mistakes
 * 	on the user's part (duplicate sequences).
 *
 * 	Unlike the SequenceSetException (which is serious deprecated anyway),
 * 	we roll SequenceExceptions INTO ourself. A SequenceListException is
 * 	ONLY thrown by a SequenceList constructor; i.e. if there's an error
 * 	loading up a SequenceList from a file.
